First, does microgravity enhance vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries, which could contribute to inadequate cerebral perfusion and postflight orthostatic intolerance? Previous studies with hindlimb unloaded rats demonstrate simulated microgravity enhances cerebral artery vasoconstrictor properties. And second, previous results from STS-131 and STS-133 experiments have shown that vasoconstrictor properties of arteries from the mesentery and gastrocnemius muscle are diminished by spaceflight. This experiment addressed whether this impairment is limited to the arterial circulation, or whether the venous circulation is likewise impaired. \n\nFunctional and structural studies were conducted on cerebral arteries and mesenteric veins to address whether the impairment of smooth muscle function occurs cerebral circulation, or is limited to the arterial circulation, i.e., whether smooth muscle cells on the venous side of the circulation are likewise affected.", "approach": "Basilar and posterior communicating arteries were isolated for in vitro and mechanical testing. Myogenic vasoconstrictor responses and passive pressure-diameter responses were obtained in basilar arteries from 12 control and 7 flight animals. Vascular stiffness, as characterized via nanoindentation, was determined in posterior communicating arteries from 12 control and 7 flight animals. For mesenteric veins, norepinephrine dose response curves were obtained from 9 control and 3 flight animals.\n\nThe cerebral arteries and mesenteric veins were isolated and placed in cold buffer solution at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and transported to the University of Florida. Basilar arteries and mesenteric veins were mounted on glass pipettes to determine constrictor properties, as well as wall thickness and maximal lumen diameter via video microscopy.", "results": "In the basilar arteries, myogenic vasoconstrictor tone was lower in flight animals relative to that in ground-control mice. Passive pressure-diameter responses were also greater in basilar arteries from flight mice, indicating greater distension of these cerebral arteries. Structural analysis demonstrated that basilar artery wall thickness and maximal diameter were unaffected by spaceflight. Posterior communicating arteries were also less stiff in mice flown on the space shuttle.\n\nVenoconstriction to norepinephrine was lower in veins from spaceflown mice. Mesenteric vein luminal diameter also increased as a function of increasing intraluminal pressure in the presence of 10-4 M NE in both groups. However, intraluminal diameter was greater at each pressure in veins from the spaceflight group.", "protocol": "", "relatedStudies": [], "relatedExperiments": [], "sponsoringAgency": {"id": "6375b508313d542fb5edc630", "annotationValue": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)", "mapping": [], "definition": "", "termSource": "", "termAccession": "", "branch": [""], "freeOntology": true}, "researchAreas": [{"id": "6375b509313d542fb5edc697", "annotationValue": "Cardiovascular physiology", "mapping": [], "definition": "", "termSource": "", "termAccession": "", "branch": [""], "freeOntology": true}], "nasaPrograms": [], "managingNasaCenters": [], "factors": [], "publications": [{"title": "Effects of Spaceflight and Ground Recovery on Mesenteric Artery and Vein Constrictor Properties in Mice", "pubMedID": "23099650", "doi": "", "status": {"id": "6375b506313d542fb5edc62e", "annotationValue": "published", "mapping": [], "definition": "", "termSource": "", "termAccession": "", "branch": [""], "freeOntology": true}, "link": "", "citation": "Behnke, B.J.; Stabley, J.N.; McCullough, D.J.; Davis, R.T.; Dominguez, J.M.; Muller-Delp, J.M.; and Delp, M.D.: Effects of Spaceflight and Ground Recovery on Mesenteric Artery and Vein Constrictor Properties in Mice.

Every effort will be made to harvest as many different samples and types of tissue from the mice as possible for other mission specific biomedical research. Positive results from this research may advance our understanding of mechanistic changes that occur in various physiological systems after exposure to microgravity and support overall efforts to reduce health risks to crewmembers.
