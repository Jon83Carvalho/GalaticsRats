Exact matched procedures were held for ground control, vivarium, and basal groups. After vehicle return, dissection of all four groups (flight, baseline, ground, vivarium) were conducted. The returned carcasses were thawed and dissected twice. The first round of carcass dissections, known as the RR1 1st thaw BSP (Biospecimen Sharing Program), spanned a 2-week period in April 2015 and a 1-week period in May 2015. The RR1 2nd thaw BSP was performed in March 2016. BSP samples were dissected, frozen, and then transferred to the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA; now NBISC [NASA Biological Institutional Scientific Collection) for long-term storage. Tissues from forty mice were received for this study, from RR-1 through BSP/ALSDA and lumbar vertebrae (L4) were assessed for cancellous bone by microcomputed tomography. Vertebrae were preserved by wrapping specimens with single 2-ply gauze squares (1/3 of a typical tri-fold gauze pad) and dipped into PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Tissues were stored in labeled specimen containers and placed on ice, and subsequently stored at -20C.     The mCT machine used for this study was a SkyScan 1174, Bruker, Belgium. The scanning was conducted at 6.7 micrometers per pixel, x-ray intensity was 800 miliamperes, and killivolt peak was 50kvp, with frame averaging of 2. A .log file from the scanning, reconstruction, and analysis from this mCT study was submitted and available for data provenance.     This study was approved by by the NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Post-pubescent female C57BL/6J mice (16 weeks at launch) were exposed to 37 days of microG flight, after being flown to the ISS, and housed in the Rodent Habitat. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The mice were acclimated to NASA Rodent Food bars, lixits, and wire floors.     To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.     An upper/lower threshold approach was used to binarize grayscale images, with a lower gray threshold of 40 and upper gray threshold of 255 (on 0-1000 scale).     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample\u2014the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was \u201cliving\u201d, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped.

BSP personnel then sacrificed mice and dissected and flash froze tissues. The authors of this study received isolated frozen tails from the post-flight mice (flight, n equals 6) and vivarium controls (control, n equals 8). The C3-C4 caudal motion segment was isolated from each specimen and thawed. The ventral side of each motion segment was marked with tissue dye to track orientation. Surrounding ligaments and soft tissues were removed to isolate the discs and vertebrae, and X-ray scans were obtained for each specimen to measure disc height as an average of three measurements taken at the center of the disc. Specimens were kept hydrated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) throughout tissue preparation.     Indication of post-flight vertebral rim fractures noted by histology prompted a mCT bone analysis. Adjacent whole motion segments were scanned using high-resolution X-ray microscopy to quantify bone mineral density and trabecular microarchitecture (mCT 50, SCANCO Medical, Bruttisellen, Switzerland). Motion segments were oriented with the longitudinal axis of the spine perpendicular to the radiation beam and scanned in 70% ethanol at a 4mm voxel size using a tube voltage of 55 kVp and an X-ray intensity of 109mA.     Image reconstruction was performed using SCANCO software and scans were analyzed using SCANCO Evaluation Program v6.5-3 to quantify bone volume fraction (BV/TV), bone mineral density (BMD), and trabecular microarchitecture (trabecular number, thickness, and spacing) on each whole motion segment. Subsequently, these same analyses were performed on a trabecular compartment of bone in the metaphysis adjacent to the cranial growth plate of each vertebra to quantify changes in parameters specific to the trabecular bone. This trabecular volume of interest (VOI) was manually delineated using an irregular contour drawn a few pixels away from the endocortical surface. The VOI began just below the growth plate on the cranial end of the vertebra and extended 1mm (250 slices) towards the diaphysis. This VOI was chosen rather than isolated epiphyses because murine epiphyses are very small (\u00020.7\u20130.8mm3) and composed largely of cortical bone, which remodels slower than trabecular bone. The chosen VOI had a larger trabecular volume which improved our statistical power for identifying bone density changes induced by spaceflight. For all analyses, a lower threshold of 300 grayscale units was used to segregate mineralized tissue from soft tissue and scan medium, and Gaussian filters with a sigma of 0.5 and support of two were applied to remove noise. Morphometric indices were calculated using a 3D model-independent algorithm, and BMD was calculated using a linear attenuation coefficient determined by calibration with a SCANCO hydroxyapatite phantom.     The content for this dataset was extracted from a meta-analysis performed by the authors of Fu et al., 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00147-7). The purpose of the meta-analysis was to mine the literature in order to quantify microgravity-induced changes to bone health in animals. The authors provided to ALSDA a global dataset, based upon 40 different literature-derived articles. In collaboration with the authors and the ALSDA Analysis Working Group (AWG), these datasets were then parsed into individual 'original' files of data. This 'original' data file is made available (so users can see original version). To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.

Fourteen male C57BL/6 mice (19\u201320 weeks old) were obtained through NASA\u2019s Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). Six mice had flown in low Earth orbit on a 30-day microgravity Bion M1 mission and were sacrificed 13\u201315 h after landing.

While bending motions are main contributors to herniation, the effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs are unknown. Consequently, the goal of this study was to quantify the bending properties of tail discs from mice with or without microgravity exposure. Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (mCT) to quantify bone properties. We observed that spaceflight significantly shortened the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduced the bending strength by 17%. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone. Together, these results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in astronauts.

Spaceflight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight. This study derives results from the DXA Scanning assay using lumbar spine tissue from HLS mice.

All procedures were approved by the UMBC and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Lighting was provided by a string of rope lights attached to the underside of the open arms of the maze. In between rats, the maze was wiped down with alcohol.     A standard rat elevated plus maze with 43 cm arms extending from a 10 cm central area was obtained from Kinder Scientific. The arms of the maze were approximately 90 cm above the floor which was covered by foam rubber.     Each session was started by placing the rat in the central area facing the open arms of the maze and lasted 5 min (300 sec). The rats that were irradiated at 7 and 16 months of age were tested 4 months post-exposure; the rats that were irradiated at 2 and 12 months of age were tested 1 month after irradiation. For most experiments the level of activity (photocell breaks) will also be reported. Unfortunately, for this specific experiment that measure got lost in damaged software and cannot be recovered.

The first replication involved exposing the 7- and 16-month old rats to 56Fe particles; the 2- and 12-month old rats were irradiated in the second replication. The doses (10 subjects per dose) to which the rats were exposed varied as a function of the age of the rats.

In addition to changes in cognitive/behavioral performance, aged rats also show an increase in baseline anxiety measured using the elevated plus maze. Exposure to 56Fe particles, a component of cosmic rays, produces neurochemical and behavioral changes in young animals which are characteristic of aged organisms. The present study was designed to determine the relationships between aging and exposure to 56Fe particles on anxiety. Fischer 344 (F344) rats, which were 2, 7, 12, and 16 months of age at the time of irradiation, were exposed to 56Fe particles (50 to 200 cGy). Concordant with previous results, the oldest rats spent less time exploring the open arms of the maze. Exposure to 56Fe particles also produced decreased exploration of the open arms of the plus maze. The dose needed to produce increased levels of anxiety was a function of age at the time of irradiation. The dose of 56Fe particles needed to produce a decrease in open arm exploration was significantly lower in the rats that were irradiated at 7 and 12 months of age than in the rats irradiated at 2 months of age. These results suggest the possibility that exposing middle aged astronauts to cosmic rays during exploratory class missions outside the magnetosphere, and the resultant effects on exploration induced anxiety, may affect their ability to successfully complete mission requirements.

It should be noted that the STS-131 mission originally carried eleven adult, female, wild-type C57BL/6 mice. However, only seven were included in the current study. One calvaria suffered multiple bone fractures from inappropriate handling and storage, and was deemed unsuitable for analysis. Three were euthanized 28 h after landing instead of within 4 h, and thus were not included in our analysis. Although the addition of these three calvariae would greatly increase the sample size, we felt that since the length of stay in microgravity was only fifteen days, the three calvariae extracted after experiencing Earth's gravity for more than one entire day may not truly reflect microgravity-induced changes and may instead introduce bias to the analysis of the samples. To compensate for this decision, we also excluded three of the eleven ground control mice with the same number of caged days prior to euthanasia.     Experimental protocol conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and was approved by the Institutional and Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Prior to experiments, all animals were deemed healthy by the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) veterinarians.\n\nSeven 23-week-old adult, female, wild-type C57BL/6 mice representing the spaceflight group (n equals 7) experienced fifteen days of microgravity aboard the 15-day NASA shuttle mission STS-131. Eight female wild-type C57BL/6 mice, littermates of the spaceflight group, were maintained on land under normal gravitational loads and represent the control group (n equals 8). Both groups were maintained on a 12:12-hour light\u2013dark cycle and provided with pre-adapted food and water ad libitum, from April 4 to 20, 2010 for the flight mice and from April 6 to 22, 2010 for the ground controls. Both groups were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules with gravity or lack thereof being the primary environmental difference. All mice were weighed twice \u2013 once just prior to cage-loading, and again after cage-unloading at the termination of the 15-day period and prior to sacrifice \u2013 and the weight change of each animal was determined.\n\nAfter mission completion, the spaceflight mice were received and euthanized at the NASA Kennedy Space Center, and their tissues were harvested within 3 to 4 h of shuttle landing. The ground control mice were identically housed for the duration of the STS-131 mission beginning 48 h after launch, and were  euthanized at the termination of their experimental duration 48 h after shuttle landing. All animals were handled and dissected by members of the Biospecimen Sharing Project at NASA-KSC.     Samples were thawed and imaged on a micro-Computed Tomography scanner, Skyscan 1076 (Kontich, Belgium). Calvariae were wrapped in tissue paper moistened with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and scanned at 9\u03bcm voxel size, applying an electrical potential of 50 kVp and current of 200uA, and using a 0.5mm aluminum filter. Tissue Mineral Density (TMD) was determined by calibration of images against 2mm diameter hydroxyapatite (HA) rods (250 and 750 mg/cm3) with a beam hardening correction algorithm applied during image reconstruction.     Bone structure and histomorphometric parameters were visualized and determined using Skyscan software, Dataviewer, CTAn (Kontich, Belgium). A volume of interest (VOI, defined by a standardized rectangular volume measuring 18mm3, 5.5mm \u00d7 1.2mm area in the coronal plane, 2.7mm depth) was located at the center of the parietal bones by identifying the intersection of the anterior lambdoid and coronal sutures with the sagittal suture to position the center of the VOI on the sagittal plane and localizing the VOI center on the coronal plane at the sagittal suture. After applying a global threshold, an erosion of one pixel was performed to eliminate partial volume effects. The following parameters were then calculated: total volume (TV, defined as the VOI), bone volume (BV, defined as the volume within the VOI occupied by bone), bone volume fraction (BV/TV, defined as the proportion of the VOI occupied by bone, expressed as a percentage), cross-sectional bone thickness (Cs.Th, measured as the thickness of the calvaria from the edge of cortical bone underlying the scalp to overlying the meninges, calculated in 2D on the basis of the plate model), and tissue mineral density (TMD, determined by\ncalibration of the attenuation values to those obtained from the HA rods).     The content for this dataset was extracted from a meta-analysis performed by the authors of Fu et al., 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00147-7). The purpose of the meta-analysis was to mine the literature in order to quantify microgravity-induced changes to bone health in animals. The authors provided to ALSDA a global dataset, based upon 40 different literature-derived articles. In collaboration with the authors and the ALSDA Analysis Working Group (AWG), these datasets were then parsed into individual 'original' files of data. This 'original' data file is made available (so users can see original version). To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a microCT data reuse template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all microCT results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. Of note, these values are groups of sample, with 'sample name 1' (group 1) having an N of 7, and 'sample name 2' (group 2) having an N of 8.     The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by biological payloads on the International Space Station (ISS) depends on a number of factors, including date and duration of exposure and location of the payload on the ISS. Some of the factors that lead to variations in the absorbed dose rate in orbit are ISS altitude, period during the solar cycle, and location of the sample\u2014the ISS module and the specific location within that module. Shielding effects from the biological payload container or habitat have not been taken into account. The measured absorbed dose can vary based on the dosimetry instrument(s) used. Radiation monitoring on the ISS is not standardized across modules; each international partner has its own suite of instruments, with differing technologies, sensitivities and analysis methodologies, including criteria for distinguishing between lightly ionizing particles (mainly protons) and highly ionizing particles (mainly galactic cosmic ray nuclei). Both active and passive dosimeters are used. Active dosimeters are powered and data are read out and stored and/or telemetered to ground. Some active dosimeters provide additional levels of detail such as time resolution, energy deposition and particle identification. Passive dosimeters are unpowered, record constantly and are read out upon return to the ground. The dose in the metadata is the dose recorded by the radiation detector closest to the sample. In most cases that detector will be in the same ISS module; in cases where data from a detector in the same module are not available, the dose is extrapolated using data from periods where data are available from detectors in multiple modules, including the module containing the payload. The duration of the experiment is defined as the time in space during which the specimen was \u201cliving\u201d, including the time on the delivery vehicle (e.g. SpaceX Dragon). Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped.

While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven 23-week-old, adult female wild-type C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight female littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 murine calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), average cortical thickness (Ct.Th), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the spaceflight (SF) group compared to that of the ground control (GC) group, the mean BV \u00b1 SD for the SF group was 1.904 \u00b1 0.842 mm3, compared to 1.758 \u00b1 0.122 mm3 for the GC group (p less than 0.05). Ct.Th demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099 \u00b1 0.006 mm in the GC group to 0.104 \u00b1 0.005 mm in the SF group (p equals 0.12). TMD was similar between the two groups with 0.878 \u00b1 0.029 g/cm3 for the GC group and 0.893 \u00b1 0.028 g/cm3 for the SF group (p equals 0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes responsive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight. These findings suggest that fluid shifts alone accompanying microgravity may initiate bone adaptation independent of skeletal loading by tissue.
